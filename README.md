## ðŸ“ƒ About community

Briefly, <b>JustEmpire</b> is a <b>closed community</b> I am part of. One day I decided to make a website so other members would have the ability to post news and projects they're creating. Another reason for making this website was to practice my skills in creating web applications with <b>Angular</b> & <b>ASP.NET</b>.

## ðŸ–¥ Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. <br>
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ðŸ›  Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. <br>
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
